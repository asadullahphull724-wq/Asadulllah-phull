           Friends are the most precious treasure of life. They are like family bonds, strong and pure. True friends always stand by us in difficult times and make happy moments even more beautiful. A friend not only understands our silence but also shares our joys and sorrows. Good friends guide us on the right path of life and save us from mistakes. It is often said that a good friend is equal to a treasure because true friendship lasts forever.</p>
